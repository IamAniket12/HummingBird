# Hummingbird ML Agent Project in Unity

## Project Overview
This project is focused on implementing a machine learning agent within Unity to simulate and study the behavior of a hummingbird. Using Unity ML-Agents, the project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of reinforcement learning in a simulated natural environment where the hummingbird navigates and interacts.

### Features
- Detailed simulation of a hummingbird in a dynamic environment.
- Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Interaction with the environment to mimic natural behaviors of a hummingbird.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
- Unity 
- ML-Agents
- C Sharp 

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Open the project in Unity by selecting the project folder.
3. Install the required ML-Agents package in Unity via the Package Manager.
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

2. Start the Unity environment and observe the training process.

## Video Demonstration
A comprehensive video demonstration of the hummingbird agent in action is available for viewing. This video provides insight into the agent's behavior, interaction with the environment, and the results of the training process.
